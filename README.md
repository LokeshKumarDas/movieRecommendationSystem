movieRecommendationSystem


In this project, I tried to replicate a movie recommendation system using nltk and some vectorization concepts.


1. Firstly download the data from 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?resource=download'.
2. Run MovieRecommenderSystemode.ipynb and generate pickle(.pkl) files.
3. Now create virtual environment(steps given in app.py).
4. run app.py to see the website(made using streamlit).


Hope this project helps you.


Thanks!!
